1.Rxjs provides us single api to deal with the data that are coming from multiple sources over time.
The data that is continuously coming to your application is often called as data streams.

Streams of data can be of:
1.synchronous data
2.Asynchronous data
3.Getting data from the server as HTTP calls
4.DOM Events
5.Function with return value.

These all data streams are processed differently with the javascript with different process.
Asynchronous data we use callbacks and promises.
For DOM Events we use event handler.
For array of data we use loops.

But is rxjs we can handle these all data by using single api. We call is as Observables.
This is defined from the pattern Observer development patterns.
